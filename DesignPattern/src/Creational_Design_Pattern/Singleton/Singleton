--Singleton--

- The purpose of singleton is to have only one instance of a class
- We required this singleton class in case of DB-Connection setup, or for restricting some resource.

- There are different way to create a singleton class
    1. Eager Initialization
    2. Lazy Initialization
    3. Synchronized Method
    4. Double Check Locking (IMP)
    5. Bill Pugh Solution (not-imp)
    6. Enum (not-imp)

- There are 3 main scenarios that breaks singleton
    1. Cloning
    2. Deserialization
    3. Reflection
